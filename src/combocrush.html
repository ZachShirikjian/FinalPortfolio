<div class = "pageparagraph"><strong>ComboCrush</strong> is a 2D action platformer where you must perform skateboarding
   tricks and combos, impressing your audience. Featuring a street-graffiti aesthetic inspired by 
   Jet Set Radio and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, ComboCrush takes players back to the early 2000s era of 
   skateboarding. The game is divided into distinct daytime and nighttime sections, each featuring 
   their own objective. During the day, players must simply get 1 million points, while at night, 
   players must reach the underground tunnel and escape the level before time runs out. At both 
   day and night, players must build up their audience’s Hype to get more points while performing tricks and combos. 
   <br><br>
   ComboCrush was created in 7 days for the annual Fall 2023 Game Jam at Fitchburg State University, which had the 
   theme “Day and Night”. I collaborated with FSU Game Design alumni <a href="https://www.pgomesprojects.com/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">Peter Gomes</a> to design the Day/Night transitions. 
   I designed the layout of the interfaces in-game, while Peter programmed and implemented their functionality in Unity. 
   ComboCrush provided me an opportunity to create a unified street graffiti theme throughout the UI and menus. As producer,
   mentored Izzy Cochran and Christan Surrett, providing them constructive feedback on their work and helping them manage 
   source control using Github. 
   <br><br>
   Vadim Mayorskiy created the environmental art, with Character Design and Concept Art made by Izzy Cochran. Music and 
   sound effects composed by Christian Surett. Alternative tracks for the Day level were composed by 
   <a href="https://www.ceruleancyanide.com/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">Cerulean Cyanide</a>, and Tina Nguyen (Crow Wanderer).
