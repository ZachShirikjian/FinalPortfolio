<div class = "pageparagraph"><strong>Colorpillar</strong> is a short 2D puzzle game which teaches people about accurate color 
  mixing. Play as an adult caterpillar who visits their childhood home for the first time in several years. Escape from the dark caterpillar chasing
  behind you as your time to reminisence on your childhood is limited. Progress through 
  each room by matching your body’s color with that of the door in the room. Interact with objects, which once had significant 
  meaning to you, causing their color to affect that of your own body. This game was my final project for the Color Dynamics class 
  at Fitchburg State University. I wanted to create a game which used color to depict feelings of nostalgia. 
  Colorpillar is heavily influenced by my personal experience with nostalgia, which has grown since the pandemic. 
  Art assets of the game were created from a limited palette of seven colors一black, white, blue, purple, green, pink, and yellow一to focus on the pure hue of each color used. The simplistic art style and minimal usage of text help tell a narrative through the environment. I worked closely with Donald Tarallo to ensure the color mixtures were optically accurate, and the game would successfully
  depict nostalgia.
