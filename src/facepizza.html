<div class = "pageparagraph"><strong>Face Pizza</strong> is a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) game, where you make pizzas off of your face! 
  Inspired by the comedic, chaotic charm of games such as WarioWare and Tomodachi Life, your 
  face is the canvas for artistic (or outrageous) creations. Make as many orders as you can 
  within 60 seconds, using toppings which move across an assembly line. Keep playing to try 
  to get a better score! Easily record videos of your funniest moments during gameplay through
  the built-in lens-recording feature on Snapchat!
  <br><br>
  This project was developed during my summer internship as a Game Developer for
  <a href="https://www.frontierdigital.io/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline;">Frontier Digital, LLC.</a> I worked with Frontier Digital founder Marcos Bueno, who served as my supervisor during the 
  project. His experience and passion for the Mixed Reality (XR) fields helped me expand my knowledge
  of UI/UX development with AR. We collaborated together to produce a fun AR experience unique to the 
  Snapchat platform.
